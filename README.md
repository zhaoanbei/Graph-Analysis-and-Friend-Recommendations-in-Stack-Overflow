# Graph-Analysis-and-Friend-Recommendations-in-Stack-Overflow
A very brief review of graph theory. Recall that a graph G is composed of a set of vertices V (also called nodes) and edges E (sometimes called links).  Each vertex  has an identity (often represented in the real world as a string or numeric “node ID”).  Each edge  is a tuple  where  represents the source or origin of the edge, and  represents the target or destination.  In the simplest case, the edge tuple above is simply the pair  but in many cases we may have additional fields such as a label or a distance.  Recall also that graphs may be indirect or directed; in indirect graphs, all edges are symmetric whereas in directed graphs, they are not.  For instance, airline flights are directed, whereas Facebook friend relationships are indirect.

In this project, I explored temporal network data of Stack Overflow with PySpark. I calculate degree centrality, traverse graph with BFS, create directed friend recommendations and visualize friends recommendations with NETWORKX  Finally, I calculate simple Page Rank with SQL.
